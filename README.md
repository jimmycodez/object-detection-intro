# object-detection-intro
This is my first project in object detection. It is a very simple app using open cv. I was able to run this and get a camera feed from my phone, which I wasnt even aware the script would do. Will be diving deeper into object detection I believe this specific script only had around 20 items that the model was trained with. You can clone and run this yourself using your iphone camera or webcam. It's a cool project to show friends/family and make them think you're smart :)
